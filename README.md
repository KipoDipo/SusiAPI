SusiAPI is a Python web scraper designed to retrieve student grades from [susi.uni-sofia.bg](susi.uni-sofia.bg). It is a simple tool that automates the process of accessing and extracting grades, saving time for students who need to frequently check their academic performance online. It also displays the accumulated ECTS credits both from the mandatory and extracurricular courses, as well the grade formed for a scholarship.

This is a personal project, created for educational purposes. It is not affiliated with the University of Sofia.
